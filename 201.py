#The range() Function

#To loop through a set of code a specified number of times,
# we can use the range() function,
#The range() function returns a sequence of numbers,
# starting from 0 by default, and increments by 1 (by default),
# and ends at a specified number.


for x in range(6):
    print(x)

#Note-- that range(6) is not the values of 0 to 6,
# but the values 0 to 5.
