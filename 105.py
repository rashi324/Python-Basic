#Remove Items
#Note: You cannot remove items in a tuple.

#Tuples are unchangeable, so you cannot remove items from it,
# but you can use the same workaround as we used for changing
# and adding tuple items:

#Convert the tuple into a list, remove "apple",
# and convert it back into a tuple ?

thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")

y = list(thistuple)
y.remove("apple")
thistuple = tuple(y)
print(thistuple)
