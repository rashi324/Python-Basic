#Create Tuple With One item

#To create a tuple with only one item,
#you have to add a comma after the item
#otherwise python will not recognize it as a tuple

#One item tuple, remember the comma:

thistuple = ("apple",)
print(type(thistuple))

#NOT a tuple
thistuple1 = ("apple")
print(type(thistuple1))
