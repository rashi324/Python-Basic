#Loop Through the index Number

#Use the range() and len() functions to create a suitable iterable.

#print all items by referring to their index number?

thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

for i in range(len(thislist)):
    print(thislist[i])

#The iterable created in the example above is [0, 1, 2].
