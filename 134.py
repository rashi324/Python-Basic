#Intersection

#Keep ONLY the duplicates

#The intersection() method will return a new set,
#that only contains the items that are present in both sets.

#Join set1 and set2, but keep only the duplicates?

set1 = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
set2 = {"google", "microsoft", "apple"}

set3 = set1.intersection(set2)
